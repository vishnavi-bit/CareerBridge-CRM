Project Title: CareerBridge CRM ‚Äì Connecting Youth Skills to Jobs
---
Problem Statement
---
Many young people cannot find jobs that match their skills. Even after learning new skills, they don‚Äôt get updates about job openings. Companies receive too many unqualified job applications, wasting their time. NGOs and governments also struggle to track how well their programs help youth get jobs. There is no single system that connects young people with training, mentorship, and job opportunities.

Proposed Salesforce Solution
---
- Youth create profiles listing their skills, qualifications, location, and job preferences.
- Companies post job openings with required skills directly in the CRM.
- Salesforce automatically matches youth profiles with relevant job opportunities.
- Youth receive email or SMS alerts for matching jobs.
- Interviews can be scheduled and tracked inside Salesforce.
- Dashboards provide real-time reports to NGOs, companies, and governments showing:
  - Number of youth placed in jobs
  - Skill gaps
  - Program progress and results
